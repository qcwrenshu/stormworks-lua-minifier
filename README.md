# stormworks-lua-minifier
awesome stormworks lua minifier for stormworks the game

imported from glitch.com after they [ran out of money for free hosting](https://blog.glitch.com/post/changes-are-coming-to-glitch/)

go to [https://qcwrenshu.github.io/stormworks-lua-minifier/](https://qcwrenshu.github.io/stormworks-lua-minifier/) for everything you need to know

uses a modified version of [luamin](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/luamin) that was itself modified by [crazyfluffypony](https://lua.flaffipony.rocks/) as well as [luaparse](https://github.com/fstirlitz/luaparse) then conducts shenanigans to minify it further in a way that hopefully doesn't break your code
